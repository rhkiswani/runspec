# runspec — Claude Code Context

## What this project is

A language-agnostic, TOML-based interface specification for anything runnable.
Runnables (scripts, apps, MCP tools) define their interface in `runspec.toml`
inside the package directory. The library parses this at runtime, validates
arguments, and exposes a rich `RunSpec` object.

Read `DESIGN.md` for the full design history and rationale.
Read `spec/SPEC.md` for the canonical format specification.

## Key Design Decisions

**Format**
- `runspec.toml` is the only supported config format — no `pyproject.toml` support
- `runspec.toml` lives inside the package directory (e.g. `mypkg/runspec.toml`), not at the project root
- Runnables are top-level sections: `[greeter]`
- `[config]` is the only reserved name — everything else is a runnable

**Internally**
- Code uses `runnables` as the dict key (not `scripts`)
- `__script__` on RunSpec refers to the runnable's name — internal naming, not format

**Types**
- Types declared as strings in spec (`"int"`, `"path"`, etc.)
- Coercion handled by language packs — `runspec-python` is bundled with `pip install runspec`
- Custom types registered via `runspec.register_type(name, coercer)`

**Validation**
- Two-pass: individual args first, group constraints second
- Keeps both extensible independently

**Autonomy**
- Defaults to `"confirm"` — safe by default, opt-in to trust
- Resolution order: per-arg → script-level → `[config]` default → library default
- Escalation rule: most restrictive level wins

**Entry points**
- Entry point name must match the runspec runnable name — enforced by convention
- `runspec` binary auto-appears when added as a dependency
- Script discovery: venv bin only (production); venv bin then TOML directory (--dev)

**Discovery**
- Production: importlib.metadata only — installed packages, no filesystem scanning
- `runspec serve --dev`: walk up to `.git/` as project root, recurse down (skipping `.venv`, `__pycache__`, `node_modules`, etc.) to collect all `runspec.toml` files
- `.git` is the only project boundary marker — language agnostic

## Inference Rules (from spec/SPEC.md)

| Condition | Inference |
|---|---|
| `default = 42` | `type = "int"` |
| `default = 3.14` | `type = "float"` |
| `default = "json"` | `type = "str"` |
| `default = false` | `type = "flag"` |
| `options = [...]` | `type = "choice"` |
| No default present | `required = true` |
| `type = "path"` only | `required = true` |

Bool must be checked before int (bool is a subclass of int in Python).

---

## Python Specifics

```bash
# Requirements
Python 3.10+   (tomllib from stdlib on 3.11+; tomli dependency on 3.10)
Zero runtime dependencies on Python 3.11+

# Environment setup
cd packages/python
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate        # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -e ".[dev]"

# Run tests
pytest

# Lint
ruff check .
ruff format --check .

# Type check
mypy runspec/
```

---

## Do Not

- Add runtime dependencies to the core library (stdlib only)
- Use `scripts` as a TOML key in runspec format examples
- Use `[tool.runspec.*]` format — `runspec.toml` only, always
- Put `runspec.toml` at the project root in examples — it belongs inside the package directory
- Change inference rules without updating `spec/SPEC.md` first
- Change the format without updating `spec/SPEC.md` first
- Name internal variables using the format key names (use `runnables`, not `scripts`)
- Use language-specific files (pyproject.toml, package.json) as project boundary markers — use `.git` only

---

## Node Specifics

```bash
# Requirements
Node 18+, TypeScript

# Environment setup
cd packages/node
npm install

# Run tests
npm test

# Build
npm run build

# Type check
npm run typecheck
```

Node mirrors the Python public API: `parse()`, `loadSpec()`, `registerType()`.
CLI commands: `init`, `discover`, `check`, `emit`, `serve`.
`run` command is not yet implemented in Node — do not add it until scoped.

---

## Current Status

Both Python and Node packages are active and published.

| Package | Version | PyPI / npm |
|---|---|---|
| `runspec` | 0.6.0 | PyPI |
| `runspec-node` | 0.6.0 | npm (tag pending) |
| `runspec-registry` | 0.1.1 | PyPI |

**Next:** Node `run` command (local subprocess + remote SSH via ssh2, matching Python's `runspec run`).

## Good Claude Code Prompt Patterns

Be specific and bounded. Examples of good prompts:

```
Read CLAUDE.md. Then look at loader.py and write tests for load_raw
covering the runspec.toml format. Put them in
packages/python/tests/test_loader.py.
```

```
Read CLAUDE.md and inference.py. The infer_arg function needs to handle
the case where both 'type' and 'options' are declared — options should
win and set type to 'choice'. Write the fix and add a test for it.
```

```
Read CLAUDE.md and parser.py. Walk me through what happens step by step
when parse() is called for a script with a subcommand.
```

Avoid open-ended prompts like "build the library" — break work into
one module or one behaviour at a time.
