## [0.19.0] — 2026-05-27

### Added

- **Arg source provenance (`Arg.source`)** — every resolved argument now carries
  a `source` field that records where its value originated. Five values:
  - `"cli"` — provided explicitly on the command line
  - `"env"` — resolved from a system environment variable (auto `RUNSPEC_X_ARG_Y`
    convention or a developer-declared `env = [...]` alias)
  - `"runspec_env"` — resolved from the `.runspec_env` file loaded at parse time
  - `"spec_default"` — came from `default = ...` in `runspec.toml`
  - `"not_set"` — no value provided and no default declared (optional arg left absent)

  The distinction between `"env"` and `"runspec_env"` is accurate: `apply_env_file`
  now returns a `frozenset` of the keys it actually wrote to `os.environ` (keys
  already present in the environment are not overwritten and are excluded). This
  frozenset is threaded through `_apply_env` so each arg's source is definitively
  classified.

- **Arg provenance in the run_summary audit record** — `configure_logging()` now
  accepts an optional `invocation_args` dict (`{argname: {value, source}}`).
  `_emit_run_summary()` includes `args` (plain values) and `arg_sources`
  (provenance strings) in the file-handler log record, closing the loop from
  `Arg.source` to the persistent audit trail.

### Changed

- `apply_env_file()` return type changed from `dict[str, str]` to
  `tuple[dict[str, str], frozenset[str]]` — callers receive both the full file
  contents and the set of keys actually applied to `os.environ`.

### Internal

- Source tracking is a parallel `sources: dict[str, str]` that flows alongside
  `parsed_values` through `_parse_argv` → `_apply_env` → `_apply_defaults` →
  `_coerce_values`. The old `_determine_source()` stub is removed.
- Bridge `_parse_log_by_run_id` and `_parse_log_sequential` now read
  `extra.arg_sources` and pass it through to `HistoryRecord.argSources`.
- `HistoryView` shows provenance badges next to arg values for non-CLI sources:
  blue "env", purple ".env" (runspec_env), gray "default" (spec_default). CLI
  args show no badge — the common case is uncluttered.

---

## [0.18.0] — 2026-05-27

### Added

- **Per-invocation `run_id` in every JSON log record** — `configure_logging()`
  now generates a UUID4 for each process invocation and injects it into every
  JSON log record as `extra.run_id` via a `_RunIdFilter` on the file handler.
  Multi-user scenarios where several operators run the same runnable concurrently
  produce interleaved records in a single log file; `run_id` lets the history
  view (and any external log aggregator) separate runs cleanly without relying
  on sequential position between `run_summary` markers.

- **`print()` capture in the audit log** — a `_StdoutTee` replaces `sys.stdout`
  after handlers are set up. Every complete line written via `print()` is
  forwarded to `logger.info` (as `runspec.print`, marked `_from_print=True`).
  The file handler captures these records; the stdout console handler suppresses
  them to avoid double-printing. The result: runnables that use `print()` for
  user-visible output (e.g. for subprocess piping) are now fully represented in
  the audit log without any code changes required.

- **`run_id` in `run_summary`** — the summary record written at process exit
  includes `extra.run_id` alongside the existing `duration_ms`, `exit_code`, and
  `events` fields.

### Internal

- Bridge `_parse_log_text` now detects `run_id` presence and routes to
  `_parse_log_by_run_id` (one `HistoryRecord` per UUID group) or falls back to
  `_parse_log_sequential` (legacy logs from <0.18).

---

## [0.17.1] — 2026-05-26

### Fixed

- **Windows: `runspec local` now discovers runnables correctly** — `runspec local`
  (text and JSON output) filtered runnables through an entry-point existence check
  that never matched on Windows because pip installs entry points as `<name>.exe`
  launchers, not bare `<name>` files. Both the `--format json` callable filter and
  the `--format text` `[not callable]` marker now check for `<name>.exe` as a
  fallback on Windows.

---

## [0.16.0] — 2026-05-26

### Breaking

- **`RUNSPEC_ARG_*` renamed to `RUNSPEC_{RUNNABLE}_ARG_*`** — per-arg
  environment variables now include the runnable name as a middle segment to
  prevent clashes when multiple runnables share the same argument name
  (e.g. `run-this --region` and `run-that --region` both reacting to
  `RUNSPEC_ARG_REGION=europe`). New form:
  `RUNSPEC_<RUNNABLE_UPPERCASED>_ARG_<ARG_NAME_UPPERCASED>`.
  Applied to Python and Node simultaneously (parser, serve, logging_setup).
  Framework vars `RUNSPEC_AGENT` and `RUNSPEC_CONFIG` are unchanged.

### Added

- **`.runspec_env` file** — a `KEY=VALUE` dotenv file loaded at parse time and
  merged into `os.environ` (existing env vars win). Path resolution: four tiers,
  first match wins: `RUNSPEC_ENV_FILE` env var → per-runnable `runspec_env` key
  in `runspec.toml` → `[config] runspec_env` key → `{sys.prefix}/.runspec_env`
  (default, silent skip if absent). Relative paths in TOML keys resolve from
  `sys.prefix`. The venv is the deployment container — values placed there stay
  there across reinstalls of the package itself.
- **`RunSpec.get_runspec_env()`** — method on the parsed result that returns
  the loaded env file contents as a `SimpleNamespace` with lowercased keys
  (`MY_API_KEY` → `ns.my_api_key`). Returns an empty namespace when no file
  was found.
- **`runspec_env` TOML key** — accepted in `[config]` and in any per-runnable
  section to override the default file path for that runnable.
- **`runspec env` CLI command** — `runspec env` shows the default resolved file
  path and its contents; `runspec env <runnable>` shows the file resolved for a
  specific runnable, annotated by which resolution tier was used.
- **`runspec_` namespace reservation** — arg names starting with `runspec_` or
  `runspec-` now raise a hard error at parse time. Reserved for the framework
  (`runspec_runnable`, `runspec_autonomy`, `runspec_agent`, etc.).

---

## [0.14.0] — 2026-05-24

### Added

- **Run summary captures real invoking user** (Python and Node). The closing
  stderr line and JSON audit record now include who actually ran the tool.
  `SUDO_USER` is captured when present so the real person is recorded even
  when running as a shared account via `sudo`.
  Format: `user: alice` (no sudo) or `user: alice → root (sudo)`.

---

## [0.13.1] — 2026-05-22

### Fixed

- **`runspec serve` no longer injects spec defaults into subprocess env** —
  `_args_to_runspec_env` was falling back to spec defaults when the MCP call
  omitted an arg, then merging those defaults after `os.environ`. This
  overwrote `RUNSPEC_ARG_*` vars already set in the server environment,
  breaking the env-var default tier through `serve`. Fix: only inject
  explicitly-provided MCP args. Applied to both Python and Node.
- Node server version string was hardcoded to `0.6.0`; now reads from
  `package.json`.

---

## [0.13.0] — 2026-05-22

### Added (Breaking)

- **`RUNSPEC_ARG_*` env var tier for all args** — every arg now automatically
  reads `RUNSPEC_ARG_<ARGNAME>` as an environment variable fallback before the
  spec default. No author opt-in required. Resolution order:
  CLI arg → `RUNSPEC_ARG_*` → `env` aliases → spec default.
- `env` field now accepts a string or list of strings for developer-declared
  env aliases (for CI, Ansible, etc.) checked after `RUNSPEC_ARG_*`.

### Breaking

- Runtime-injected subprocess vars renamed: `RUNSPEC_DEBUG` →
  `RUNSPEC_ARG_DEBUG`, `RUNSPEC_NO_SUMMARY` → `RUNSPEC_ARG_NO_SUMMARY`, all
  other runtime-injected arg vars gain the `_ARG_` infix for consistency.
  Framework vars `RUNSPEC_AGENT` and `RUNSPEC_CONFIG` are unchanged.

---

## [0.12.2] — 2026-05-21

### Fixed

- **`parse()` now locates `runspec.toml` next to the calling module**, not just
  by walking up from `cwd`. Installed entry points (via `pip install`,
  `poetry install`, `uv sync`, etc.) previously only worked when the user
  happened to be inside the source tree — the cwd-walk never reached
  `site-packages/<pkg>/runspec.toml`. Resolution order is now:
  explicit `config_path=` → `RUNSPEC_CONFIG` env var → walk up from the
  caller's `__file__` (new) → walk up from cwd (fallback) → error.
  Verified end-to-end with `pip`, `poetry`, and `uv` in both editable and
  wheel install modes. Python only.

---

## [0.12.1] / [node-0.11.1] — 2026-05-21

### Fixed

- **File handler now follows the `--debug` toggle** — was previously hard-wired
  to DEBUG, which meant every imported library logging to root at DEBUG
  (urllib3, boto3, sqlalchemy, etc.) flooded the audit file. The file now
  defaults to INFO and flips to DEBUG together with stdout when `--debug` /
  `RUNSPEC_DEBUG=1` is set. Stderr stays pinned at WARNING. No new TOML key —
  the existing `--debug` flag auto-added by `[config.logging]` just governs
  both surfaces now. Applies to both Python and Node.

---

## [0.12.0] / [node-0.11.0] — 2026-05-20

### Changed

- **Console routing by level** — a single `logger.X` call now does the right
  thing in both CLI mode and agent mode. INFO and below go to stdout (plain
  message, reads like `print()`); WARNING and above go to stderr (prefixed
  with the level name). The split matches Unix stream conventions and means
  `runspec serve` can capture stdout as the MCP tool response without losing
  warnings/errors. Applies to both Python and Node.

### Removed

- **`level` knob** in `[config.logging]` — silencing INFO would break agent
  responses, so the threshold is no longer configurable.

### Added

- **`--debug` flag**, auto-added when `[config.logging]` is present (also
  settable via `RUNSPEC_DEBUG=1`). Includes DEBUG records and tracebacks on
  stdout for in-terminal debugging. The flag only *raises* visibility — it
  never silences anything. The `debug` name is reserved when
  `[config.logging]` is present.

---

## [0.11.0] / [node-0.10.0] — 2026-05-20

### Added

- **Extra fields on logger calls** — attach structured context to any log record.
  - Python: `logger.info('msg', extra={'user_id': '42', 'region': 'eu-west'})`
    (standard stdlib `extra=` API — no wrapper needed).
  - Node: `logger.info('msg', { user_id: '42', region: 'eu-west' })`;
    the `error` key is special and extracts an `Error` object.
  - Extra fields appear nested under `"extra"` in JSON file output and as
    `{key=value ...}` appended to console lines.
  - Sensitive key names (`token`, `password`, `api_key`, `secret`, etc.) are
    unconditionally redacted; other string values pass through the standard
    sensitive-data filter.

---

## [0.10.0] — 2026-05-20

### Added

- **`[config.logging]`** — define logging behaviour in `runspec.toml`. When
  present, `parse()` automatically configures Python's stdlib logging system.
  Developers just use `logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)` — no extra imports
  or setup calls needed.

  - **File logging** always on: `{package_dir}/logs/{runnable}.log`, structured
    JSON at DEBUG, with `midnight` rotation (7-day retention by default).
    Falls back to `~/logs/` when the package directory is not writable.
  - **Console logging** (non-agent mode): human-readable `HH:MM:SS LEVEL
    logger: msg`; tracebacks only when `level = "debug"`.
  - **Agent mode** (`RUNSPEC_AGENT=1`): no console handler — stderr is the
    MCP/SSH streaming side-channel. File log is the debugging interface.
  - **`--log-level` arg** auto-injected when `[config.logging]` is present,
    defaulting to the configured `level`. Also settable via `RUNSPEC_LOG_LEVEL`.
  - **Sensitive data filter** applied to all output: passwords, tokens,
    `Authorization` headers, URL credentials, and JSON/form-encoded credential
    fields are replaced with `[REDACTED]`. Filter errors are silent.
  - Rotation: `"N MB"`, `"N KB"`, `"N GB"` (size), `"daily"`, `"midnight"`,
    `"weekly"` (time). Defaults to midnight/7.

- **`RunSpec.runspec_prefix`** — new property returning the parent directory of
  `runspec.toml` (the package root). Useful when runnables need to resolve paths
  relative to the package.

---

## [node-0.9.0] — 2026-05-20

### Added

- **`[config.logging]`** ported to Node/TypeScript — parity with Python 0.10.0.
  When `[config.logging]` is present, `parse()` configures a lightweight logger
  automatically. Runnables call `getLogger(name)` (exported from `runspec-node`)
  to obtain a named logger; no other setup required.

  - **File logging** always on: `{package_dir}/logs/{runnable}.log`, structured
    JSON at DEBUG, with `midnight` rotation (7-day retention by default).
    Falls back to `~/logs/` when the package directory is not writable.
  - **Console logging** (non-agent mode): human-readable `HH:MM:SS LEVEL
    logger: msg`; tracebacks only when `level = "debug"`.
  - **Agent mode** (`RUNSPEC_AGENT=1`): no console handler.
  - **`--log-level` arg** auto-injected; also settable via `RUNSPEC_LOG_LEVEL`.
  - **Sensitive data filter** on all output: passwords, tokens, `Authorization`
    headers, URL credentials, and JSON/form-encoded credential fields replaced
    with `[REDACTED]`.
  - Rotation: `"N MB"`, `"N KB"`, `"N GB"` (size), `"daily"`, `"midnight"`,
    `"weekly"` (time). Zero new runtime dependencies — stdlib `fs`/`path`/`os`
    only.

- **`runspec_prefix`** — new getter on `ParsedArgs` returning the directory
  containing `runspec.toml` (the package root).

---

## [0.9.0] — 2026-05-19

### Fixed

- `runspec jump` error messages now tailor to whether the bin path was set
  explicitly or discovered via `PATH`, giving actionable guidance in each case.
- Locked the `jump-hosts.bin` field to `runspec`-named executables only —
  prevents accidental redirection to arbitrary binaries on the remote.
- `RUNSPEC_CONFIG` is now forwarded to MCP-served subprocesses, so jump
  invocations through `runspec serve` can find their config correctly.
- `--list-jump-hosts` JSON output now shows the effective `bin` value rather
  than `null` when the default is in use.
- Remote tool failures are correctly propagated as non-zero exit codes from
  `runspec jump`.

---

## [0.7.0] — 2026-05-18

### Changed

- **CLI renamed** — `discover` → `local`, `run` → `jump`. The `check` and `emit`
  commands have been absorbed into `local` (use `runspec local` for inline
  validation, `runspec local --format mcp` for schema emission).

- **`runspec local`** — lists every installed runspec-aware runnable with inline
  validation. Exits with code 1 on errors, making it usable as a CI check.
  Accepts `--format text|json|mcp|openai|anthropic` and `--script <name>` flags.

- **`runspec jump`** — replaces `runspec run`. Without a tool name, queries the
  registry and lists all available tools and their hosts. With a tool name and
  `--host`, connects via SSH and runs the tool. Everything after `--` is passed
  to the remote tool.

- **Subcommand flattening in `runspec serve`** — runnables with nested
  `.commands` are automatically expanded into flat MCP tools with
  underscore-joined names (e.g. `portal-api_orders_get-list`). The command path
  is prepended to argv at invocation time.

- **Script discovery in `runspec serve`** is now venv-bin only. The previous
  fallback that searched the TOML directory and guessed file extensions has been
  removed. Scripts must be installed (`pip install` or `pip install -e .`).

---

## [0.5.0] — 2026-05-18

### Added

- **Recursive dev-mode discovery** — `find_configs_dev()` now walks the full
  directory tree under the `.git` root, not just one level deep. Monorepos
  with `packages/python/mypkg/runspec.toml` layouts are found automatically.
  Skips `.venv`, `__pycache__`, `node_modules`, `dist`, `build`, and all
  hidden directories.

- **`test_finder.py`** — new test file covering `find_config` (walk-up) and
  `find_configs_dev` (recursive scan, skip dirs, multiple configs, no-git
  fallback).

### Changed

- **`runspec.toml` is now the sole supported format.** Support for reading
  runspec configuration from `pyproject.toml` (under `[tool.runspec.*]`) has
  been removed. All docs, specs, and examples updated accordingly.

---

## [0.2.0] — 2026-05-17

### Added

- **`runspec serve`** — starts a live MCP stdio server for the current environment.
  Exposes every runnable as an MCP tool over JSON-RPC 2.0 on stdin/stdout.
  Zero extra dependencies. Connect to Claude Desktop or any MCP-compatible agent
  via `claude_desktop_config.json`.

- **`output` field on runnables** — declares what the runnable writes to stdout.
  Values: `"text"` (default), `"json"` (agent can parse the response),
  `"html"` (reserved for future UI use).
  Surfaces as `x-output` in all emitted schemas.

- **`args.__agent__`** — `RunSpec` now exposes `__agent__: bool`. It is `True`
  when the runnable is called via `runspec serve` (detected from `RUNSPEC_AGENT=1`
  in the environment). Use it to switch output format for agent vs human callers.

- **Installed package discovery** — `runspec discover` now finds packages in the
  current Python environment that list `runspec` as a dependency. Checks package
  data files for a shipped `runspec.toml`, and falls back to `direct_url.json`
  for editable installs.

---

## [0.1.1] — 2026-05-17

### Fixed

- Added `Documentation` URL to PyPI metadata (previously a dead link on the
  project page).

---

## [0.1.0] — 2026-05-17

### Added

Initial release.

- **`runspec.parse()`** — finds config, resolves runnable, parses `sys.argv`,
  validates, coerces, and returns a `RunSpec`.
- **`RunSpec`** — argument namespace with full spec metadata (`__script__`,
  `__source__`, `__command__`, `__autonomy__`, `__spec__`, `__groups__`).
- **`Arg`** — transparent value wrapper; behaves as its native type in all
  expressions (arithmetic, comparison, iteration, path methods).
- **Inference rules** — type and required inferred from defaults and options.
- **Types** — `str`, `int`, `float`, `bool`, `flag`, `path`, `choice`.
- **Validation** — two-pass: individual args first, group constraints second.
- **Groups** — `exclusive`, `inclusive`, `at-least-one`, `exactly-one`,
  `conditional`.
- **Subcommands** — nested command dispatch under a runnable.
- **Autonomy** — per-runnable and per-arg levels; most restrictive wins.
- **`runspec check`** — validates the current project's runspec setup.
- **`runspec discover`** — finds runspec-aware runnables in the local project.
- **`runspec emit`** — emits tool schemas in MCP, OpenAI, or Anthropic format.
- **`register_type()`** — register custom types with a coercer function.
- **`load_spec()`** — loads spec without parsing `sys.argv` (for tooling).
- Python 3.10–3.13 support. Zero runtime dependencies on Python 3.11+.
