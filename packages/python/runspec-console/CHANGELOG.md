## [0.1.9] — 2026-05-29

### Changed
- SSH terminal now launches PuTTY in a separate window instead of embedding xterm.js — simpler, no PTY resize issues, full PuTTY feature set
- Removed @xterm/xterm and @xterm/addon-fit dependencies (wheel size reduced)


## [0.1.8] — 2026-05-29

### Fixed
- Display name in log operator field now shows full Windows display name (`GetUserNameEx(3)`) instead of login name
- Local history now correctly reads from `~/logs` fallback when the venv path has no logs directory
- Settings drawer footer now shows correct config filename (`config.toml` in `%APPDATA%\runspec-console\`)


## 0.1.7 (2026-05-29)

### Added
- SSH terminal tabs: right-click any connected remote host in the sidebar → **Open SSH terminal**
- Full xterm.js terminal with ANSI colour support, scrollback, and dark theme matching the app
- Multiple terminal tabs open simultaneously, each closeable with ×
- Terminal panes stay mounted when switching to other tabs (session preserved)
- Uses plink (PuTTY) on Windows for reliable PTY allocation; falls back to OpenSSH `ssh -t`
- `open_terminal`, `terminal_input`, `resize_terminal`, `close_terminal` methods on Bridge
- 19 unit tests covering terminal session lifecycle in `tests/test_terminal.py`

## [0.1.6] — 2026-05-28

### Added
- **Configurable SSH client** — a new *SSH client binary* field in Settings → General lets you point runspec-console at any SSH-compatible binary. Set it to `plink.exe` (or a full path) to use PuTTY's plink instead of the Windows OpenSSH client — useful on corporate machines where the built-in OpenSSH client has MAC negotiation issues. The setting is stored as `[ssh] binary` in `runspec_config.toml` and applies to all SSH operations: connectivity probes, runnable discovery, invocation, history retrieval, and host tests. plink's `-batch` / `-connecttimeout` flags are used automatically when plink is detected.

## [0.1.5] — 2026-05-28

### Fixed
- **Window controls non-functional** — `minimize_window`, `toggle_maximize_window`, `close_window`, `resize_window`, and `move_window` were missing from `bridge.py`. The custom title bar buttons and resize handles now work correctly.

## [0.1.4] — 2026-05-28

### Fixed
- **Corrupted wheel** — `bridge.py` was written with null bytes during the 0.1.3 build due to a stale Linux mount cache. The wheel now contains clean source files and imports correctly.

## [0.1.3] — 2026-05-28

### Added
- **Smart output rendering** — run blocks that produce a JSON array of objects are automatically rendered as a sortable table; JSON objects render as a key-value grid. Numeric fields with `_mb`, `_kb`, `_bytes`, `_pct`, or `_seconds` suffixes are humanised (e.g. `1073741824 bytes` → `1.0 GB`).
- **View toggle** — table/grid blocks show table-view and raw-output toggle buttons so you can switch between the structured view and the raw JSON at any time.
- **Copy output** — each run block has a copy-to-clipboard button; copies the formatted table text when in table view, raw JSON otherwise. Uses `execCommand` fallback for WebView2 compatibility.
- **Ask LLM** — each run block has a robot button that forwards the raw JSON output into the chat input so the LLM can reason over it.
- **`RUNSPEC_AGENT=1` env var** — runnables invoked via the LLM chat (MCP tool calls) now have `RUNSPEC_AGENT=1` set in their environment, so they can detect agent context and adjust output format accordingly.

## [0.1.2] — 2026-05-27

### Added
- **Multi-venv host support** — hosts config now accepts `runspec_paths` (a list of runspec binary paths, one per virtual environment). A single jump host entry can now target multiple venvs; the console discovers runnables from all of them and routes invocations to the correct one automatically
